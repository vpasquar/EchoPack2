# EchoPack(WIP)e
A forum that provides a way for people communicate to other though a simple and clean interface. The repository for the first iteration of the project can be found here: https://github.com/Mike-C25/EchoPack. The first iteration uses some older-school HTML templating with handlebars.js as a front-end framework. The second iteration you see here replaces handlebars.js with react.js and adds authentication with passport.js and express-sessions with secure password encryption. Feel free to sign up and post on any of the topics!
